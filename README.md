  This is a mean reversion system that uses customized candlestick pattern. It trades whenever the price of the equity is outside the bollinger bands,50 ema is above the 200 ema (for an uptrend); (vice versa for a downtrend),followed by the candlestick confirmation pattern, and must be in confluence with the overbought and oversold signals given by the relative strength index.
  
  This strategy uses two candlestick pattern as a price action confirmation. The first is pinbar, but it was tweaked and modify to satisfy what i wanted to happen, in a bullish case scenario: The wick of the candle confirmation must be three times longer compared to the body, the body must also touch atleast 75% of the body; 25% for bearish case scenario. The second price action confirmation is engulfing candlestick bar, The body of candle[1] must be bigger compared to candle[2], candle[1] is the candle after candle[2].
  
  I backtested this strategy on 21 currency pairs, focusing only on major and cross pairs, on a 10 year scale starting from January 2010 - January 2020. Only one currency pair appears to be profitable, and that is the eurjpy, despite showing profitableness on a certain pair, i believe it wasn't still good enough since it only produces 200+ trades and a profit of 15%+, for a daytrading strategy this numbers doesn't seem to show any statistical significance.
